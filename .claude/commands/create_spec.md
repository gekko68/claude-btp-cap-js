# Technical Specification Generator

Your objective is to produce a complete technical specification.

## Information Gathering Phase
First, ask me detailed questions about the specification requirements. I'll provide the necessary information for you to understand the scope and context.

Then, ask any additional clarifying questions needed before starting the specification.

Do not begin writing until everything is clear.

## Specification Rules
- Never write real code, only pseudo-code when necessary
- Use Mermaid diagrams to enhance understanding
- Keep explanations concise and clear
- Include a complete implementation roadmap at the end

## Final Deliverable
Save the completed specification as a Markdown file.

If you get stuck or need guidance, ask me questions to stay on track.
