- **API Clarity**: Clear separation between data operations and business operations

**Implementation Details**:
```cds
// Service definition approach
service BookshopService {
  entity Books as projection on db.Books;  // Generic CRUD
  action createBook(...) returns Books;    // Custom business logic
  function getBooksByGenre(...) returns array of Books; // Optimized queries
}
```

**Trade-offs Accepted**:
